# Tesla Model Y Delivery Checklist

The following is a distillation of posts from [`r/TeslaModelY`](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/). The list
is not meant to replace Tesla's QC and thus doesn't offer 100% coverage. Rather, the contributions from MY owners
who already walked the path aim to cover recurring problems that unfortunately seem to escape quality control at
the factory as well as at the service centers.
 
Use it to guide your inspection, point things out and document findings, and assemble a list of problems to be handled
by Tesla as pre-delivery issue(s). 

Pull requests welcome.

## Final thoughts
Please don't be that guy that block Tesla deliveries and staff for hours going over your new car with a microscope. You can report all of the above after you get home, at your leisure. You have a day/100 miles. It’s not like you won’t accept the car because of some minor issue that can be fixed by a mobile service tech later (but won’t be fixed at pickup). Critical things to check on site are VIN, color, wheels, etc. and critical safety, like being able to lock/unlock the car and put it in park. Check the local super charger while you are there, too.
